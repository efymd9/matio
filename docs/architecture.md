# Architecture

How the pieces fit together. Sibling docs: [services](./services.md), [operations](./operations.md), [gotchas](./gotchas.md). For the original product spec see `PROJECT.md` (build phases, gotchas, timeline).

```

Server components can **read** cookies but cannot set them — that's why the `trial_session` cookie is issued by the `/api/playback-token` route handler (which is also the gate that verifies the show is real + published + ready before persisting any state). See [gotchas](./gotchas.md#nextjs-cookie-rules).

## Data model

Schemas live in `db/schema/`, one file per logical domain (CLAUDE.md convention). All DB access is through Drizzle — never raw SQL except inside migrations.

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Clerk-id-keyed mirror of Clerk users | `id` (Clerk user id, PK), `email`, `role` (`user`\|`admin`), `stripe_customer_id` |
| `subscriptions` | Stripe-mirrored subscription state | `user_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `status`, `plan`, `current_period_end`, `cancel_at_period_end`, `created_at` (independent of `updated_at` so churn analytics don't drift on later webhook updates) |
| `stripe_events` | Webhook idempotency log | `event_id` (PK, the Stripe event id) — claimed via INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING before the handler runs; conflicts return 200 OK with no work. Rolled back (DELETE) on handler exception so Stripe's retry can re-attempt |
| `shows` | The catalog | `slug` (unique), `genre[]`, `status` (`draft`\|`published`), `deleted_at` (soft-delete) |
| `seasons` | Season per show | `(show_id, number)` unique |
| `episodes` | Episode with Mux linkage | `mux_asset_id`, `mux_playback_id`, `mux_playback_policy` (`public`\|`signed`), `status` (`processing`\|`ready`\|`errored`), `intro_start_seconds` + `intro_end_seconds` (nullable; drive the "Skip intro" chip), `(season_id, number)` unique |
| `trial_sessions` | Anonymous-first 60s trial | `(session_token, show_id)` unique, `expires_at`, `user_id` (nullable, set on signup), `converted`, `last_position_seconds`, `ip_hash` (HMAC-SHA256 of `x-vercel-forwarded-for`; drives per-(IP, show) trial rate-limit) |
| `watch_progress` | Per-user, per-episode resume position | `(user_id, episode_id)` unique |

FK cascade defaults: deleting a `show` removes its `seasons` → `episodes` → `trial_sessions` (via FK CASCADE). `users.id` cascades into `subscriptions` and `watch_progress`; nulls out `trial_sessions.user_id`.

Hot-path indexes (migration 0010): `subscriptions(user_id, updated_at DESC)` for AlreadySubscribed / history reads, `watch_progress(episode_id)` for the episodes→progress join in admin analytics, `trial_sessions(show_id)` + `trial_sessions(user_id)` for cascade deletes + signup linking. Postgres doesn't auto-index FK columns; without these, every hot read does a sequential scan at scale.

## Auth model

- Clerk owns identity + sessions.
- `users` table mirrors Clerk via `user.created` webhook (`app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`) — handler is idempotent (`onConflictDoNothing` on `users.id`).
- `users.role` is the **only** source of truth for admin — never Clerk metadata alone.
- Clerk's hosted UI (sign-in modal, sign-up modal, UserButton dropdown, validation copy) is localized to match the site dictionary via `ClerkProvider`'s `localization` prop in `app/layout.tsx` — `esES` by default, `enUS` when the locale cookie flips. Adding a locale to the site = also add its `@clerk/localizations` bundle to the `CLERK_LOCALIZATIONS` map.
- `proxy.ts` is the first line of defense; pages/actions use `lib/admin.ts` helpers as belt-and-braces:
  - `getCurrentUser()` — pure read, returns the local row or `null`. Use for pages that can tolerate a missing mirror (e.g. analytics-only callsites).
  - `getOrSyncCurrentUser()` — read-or-upsert from `currentUser()` if the local row is missing. Use anywhere a missing mirror would block the user from making progress (e.g. `/subscribe` page render before `linkTrialSessionsToCurrentUser`, `startCheckout` server action, `/api/billing-portal` route). Closes the race where a brand-new signup hits these surfaces before the `user.created` webhook lands.
  - `getCurrentAdmin()` / `requireAdmin()` — role-gated variants for admin pages and actions.
- `users.email` is required because the promote-to-admin script and Stripe customer lookups both rely on it.

## Trial system (the most subtle piece)

End-to-end:

1. **Visiting `/watch/<slug>`** (`app/watch/[showSlug]/page.tsx`):
   - The show must be `status='published' AND deleted_at IS NULL`, else `notFound()`.
   - Signed-in + active subscription → render Player in `subscriber` mode.
   - Else: read the `trial_session` cookie (may be absent). `findTrialSession(cookie, show.id)` is a **read-only** lookup that returns the row if one exists for this (cookie, show).
     - Row found and `now > expires_at` → redirect to `/subscribe?show=<slug>&resume=<last_position_seconds>`. `resume` is only included when the row hasn't yet `converted` — for a former subscriber, the trial offset is stale.
     - Row found and active, OR no row yet → render Player in `trial` mode. The trial 60-second clock has **not** started — it begins when the player actually requests a token.
   - **Not** a shortcut: `trial.converted = true` does **not** grant subscriber-mode rendering. Access for converted-and-still-paying users is granted via the active-subscription lookup above; converted-but-canceled users get the same trial-expired flow as any anonymous visitor.
2. **Player mounts** (`components/watch/player.tsx`):
   - Outer `Player` picks the initial episode; the inner `EpisodePlayback` (keyed on `current.id`) does the actual playback work.
   - Inner fetches `/api/playback-token?episode_id=<id>` on mount with an `AbortController` guard — checks `typeof AbortController !== 'undefined'` and falls back to a `cancelled` flag for iOS < 12.2 (see [gotchas → AbortController](./gotchas.md#abortcontroller-ios-122)). Cancels in-flight on episode swap so a slow response can't race the new fetch. Captures `token` + `expiresIn`, sets `expiresAt = Date.now() + expiresIn*1000`.
   - Renders `<MediaController>` + `<MuxVideo slot="media" playbackId tokens={{ playback }} />` (headless mux-video + media-chrome — not `@mux/mux-player-react`).
   - `setTimeout((expiresAt - now) - 60_000)` fires **60s before** expiry → re-fetches token. Early rotation is required because Mux validates the JWT `exp` per-segment-request — a refresh at the boundary races segments that go out a hair late. 5xx and network errors retry with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s, 4 attempts total) before falling through to the `unavailable` end-state; the existing token keeps playing through the retry window so a transient network blip doesn't black out the player. Non-success responses are still classified into distinct end-states via `classifyTokenStatus(r.status)`:
     - **403** → `Paywall` overlay (trial preview ended naturally — "Sign up to keep watching"). Trial users land here at the natural expiry.
     - **429** → `RateLimitedNotice` overlay (trial cap hit for this network — "Too many previews this hour", still offers subscribe)
     - **5xx / network / JSON parse failure / `<video>` decode error** → `PlaybackUnavailable` overlay with a retry button; the retry bumps `fetchKey` so the token-fetch effect re-runs without unmounting the controller
   - On the trial 403 (paywall), `videoRef.current.pause()` is called alongside the end-state flip so the buffered-ahead Mux stream stops at the cutoff. The refresh path no longer calls `pause()` on transient 5xx — the existing token may still have headroom.
   - The `<video>` `onError` handler uses a rolling 10-second / 3-error window before flipping to `PlaybackUnavailable`. `MediaError.code` 3 (`MEDIA_ERR_DECODE`) and 4 (`MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED`) flip immediately; code 1 (`MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED`) is ignored; code 2 (`MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK`) counts toward the threshold but lets Mux/HLS retry first. A single rendition-switch hiccup on cellular previously killed the player permanently.
   - Every 10s **while visible and playing**, writes `last_position_seconds` (trial → `trial_sessions`) or `watch_progress` (subscriber). The interval is gated on `document.visibilityState === "visible"` and a final flush fires on `visibilitychange` (hide) and `pagehide` — without it, mobile users lost up to 10s every time they backgrounded the app. Both writes clamp the position to `[0, 24h]` server-side; the trial path additionally verifies the episode is `status='ready'` on a `published`, non-deleted show.
3. **Token endpoint** (`app/api/playback-token/route.ts`) — this is the actual gate. The handler:
   - Joins episode → season → show and filters on `episodes.status='ready' AND shows.status='published' AND shows.deleted_at IS NULL`. A leaked draft episode id returns 404 here, regardless of any cookie.
   - Signed-in user with `subscriptions.status='active'` → 1h subscriber JWT.
   - Otherwise enters the trial path:
     - Reads the `trial_session` cookie (may be absent — that's normal for a first-time visitor since proxy.ts no longer mints it).
     - If a trial row exists for (cookie, show) and `remaining > 0` → JWT with `ttl = min(remaining, TRIAL_DURATION_SECONDS)`.
     - If a trial row exists and is expired → 403 (no re-trial on the same cookie/show).
     - If no row yet → `mintTrialSession({ sessionToken, showId, ipHash })`: enforces a per-(`ip_hash`, `show_id`) cap of `TRIAL_RATELIMIT_PER_HOUR = 3` trial creations / hour, inserts the row, sets the `trial_session` cookie if it was missing, and returns the JWT. Cap exceeded → 429.
4. **IP rate-limit details**:
   - `hashClientIp(ip)` returns `HMAC-SHA256(MUX_SIGNING_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY, ip)` so the bucket is stable across requests but unrecoverable without the Mux signing key (no raw IPs in the DB).
   - Client IP is sourced **only** from `x-vercel-forwarded-for` — Vercel sets it to a single, untainted client IP. The standard `x-forwarded-for` is appended-to (not replaced) at the edge, so its leftmost entry is whatever the client sent; using it let an attacker rotate IPs by varying the header. If the trusted header is missing (e.g. local dev), the bucket key falls back to a constant `"unknown"`, which puts all unidentified requests into one shared bucket — fail-CLOSED under abuse, painless in dev.
   - The cap is **per-(IP, show)** — a household watching a different show on the same IP isn't disrupted.
   - 429 responses include `Retry-After: 3600` and a generic body (no "from this network" framing — no need to confirm to an adversary that they hit a per-network bucket).
5. **Conversion linking**:
   - **Page-level** (primary): `/subscribe` server component runs `linkTrialSessionsToCurrentUser()` on render — claims any trial rows with the user's cookie that have `user_id IS NULL`. Catches the common case (user comes from trial → Subscribe → signup → back to /subscribe).
   - **Stripe webhook**: when `customer.subscription.*` lands with active/trialing status, `markUserTrialsConverted(user.id)` flips `converted=true` on all the user's trial rows. This is an **analytics-only** marker (powers the trial→paid metric on the admin dashboard). It does not affect playback — gating is purely based on `subscriptions.status='active'` and the trial expiry timestamp.

Constants in `lib/trial.ts`: `TRIAL_DURATION_SECONDS = 60`, `TRIAL_RATELIMIT_PER_HOUR = 3`. `/api/playback-token` imports the duration as `TRIAL_TTL_CAP` so the JWT can never outlive the row.

## Playback pipeline

```
Admin uploads via @mux/upchunk (components/admin/upload-widget.tsx)
        │
        ▼ (Server Action createMuxUpload)
mux.video.uploads.create({ playback_policies: ["signed"], passthrough: episode.id })
        │  (no DB writes here — see "re-upload safety" below)
        ▼ (browser uploads chunks directly to Mux)
upchunk fires `success` → client calls markEpisodeReprocessing(episodeId)
        │
        ▼ (DB: status="processing", mux_asset_id=NULL, mux_playback_id=NULL, …)
Mux processes (transcodes etc.)
        │
        ▼ (video.asset.ready webhook → app/api/webhooks/mux/route.ts)
episodes.mux_asset_id / mux_playback_id / mux_playback_policy /
duration_seconds / status="ready"
        │
        ▼ (user visits /watch/<slug>)
Player fetches /api/playback-token → RS256 JWT (lib/mux-token.ts)
        │
        ▼
<MediaController>
  <MuxVideo slot="media" playbackId tokens={{ playback }} />
  <!-- custom chrome (media-chrome React primitives) -->
</MediaController>
```

`passthrough` carries the episode id through Mux → webhook → our DB without needing an extra column. Webhook uses `mux.webhooks.unwrap(body, headers, secret)` for signature verification.

**Re-upload safety**: `createMuxUpload` deliberately doesn't touch the episode row — it only mints the upload URL. The DB clearing happens in `markEpisodeReprocessing`, which the upload widget calls **after** upchunk's `success` event fires (i.e., the browser → Mux upload has actually completed). Previously `createMuxUpload` cleared playback fields preemptively, which meant a cancelled mid-upload left the row stuck in `status='processing'` with no path back: the Mux webhook's `resolveEpisodeFromPassthrough` refuses to overwrite a different existing `mux_asset_id` (anti-spoofing — see [gotchas → Mux SDK](./gotchas.md#mux-sdk-14)), so no later upload could rescue it. With the clear-on-success ordering, a cancelled upload simply leaves the previous asset live.

**Caveat**: existing assets uploaded before the policy switch have **public** playback IDs and play without a token. Re-upload to gate them — or run `pnpm backfill:mux-policy` if the script applies.

## Player architecture

The watch surface uses **headless `<mux-video>` + media-chrome** for full visual control. `@mux/mux-player-react` is retained only for the auto-playing hero preview on `/`.

**File layout:**
- `components/watch/watch-shell.tsx` — fullscreen black canvas, cursor auto-hide on idle (`mousemove`/`mousedown`/`touchstart` listeners throttled via `requestAnimationFrame` to avoid re-rendering on every pixel of mouse movement). No max-width; player sizes itself.
- `components/watch/player.tsx` — split into two components in one file:
  - **`Player` (outer)** — owns state that should survive episode swaps: `currentEpisodeId`, overlay visibility, lock toggle, and the `swap` callback that updates the URL.
  - **`EpisodePlayback` (inner, `key={current.id}`)** — owns per-episode state: token, expiresAt, paywall, aspect ratio, captions detection, skip-intro chip, last-saved position. The `key` prop is what makes this work: every episode swap unmounts and remounts the inner, so all per-episode state resets to its initial value naturally. This pattern is required by React 19's `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rule — see [gotchas → React 19 hooks rules](./gotchas.md#react-19-hooks-rules).
  - **Overlays are `next/dynamic` imports** (`ssr: false`): `Paywall`, `PlaybackUnavailable`, `RateLimitedNotice`, `EpisodesOverlay`, and `UpNextOverlay` are all loaded via `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`. This keeps ~30KB+ of overlay code (and their transitive deps) out of the initial player bundle — none of these render on first paint. The dynamic boundary also means their portal'd `document.body` references are safe without the `useSyncExternalStore` mounted guard at the import site.
- `components/watch/episodes-overlay.tsx` — season-grouped episode picker. Portal'd to `document.body` (see [gotchas → media-chrome overlays](./gotchas.md#media-chrome)). Uses `useSyncExternalStore` for an SSR-safe "are we on the client" check (not `useState + useEffect(setMounted)` — see gotchas). Has a manual focus trap: close button receives initial focus, Tab/Shift+Tab cycle within the dialog, Escape dismisses.
- `components/watch/up-next-overlay.tsx` — bottom-right slide-in card with 7-second auto-advance. Same `useSyncExternalStore` SSR pattern. Renders as `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"` with Escape-to-dismiss. The countdown text has `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` so screen readers announce the remaining seconds. "Watch now" button receives initial focus.
- `components/watch/paywall.tsx` — bottom-sheet overlay shown on trial 403. Leads with **sign-up**, not plan selection: primary CTA is Clerk's `<SignUpButton mode="modal" forceRedirectUrl="/subscribe?show=…&resume=…">`. Signed-in non-subscribers (rare — paid → canceled → returned) get a direct `<Link>` to `/subscribe` instead. A secondary "Already have an account? Sign in" link uses `<SignInButton>` with matching redirect. Plan picking happens after signup, on `/subscribe` — two decisions ("which plan?" + "make an account?") at the same in-player moment was decision overload.
- `components/watch/playback-status.tsx` — `RateLimitedNotice` (429) and `PlaybackUnavailable` (5xx / network / video decode) overlays. Same visual idiom as `Paywall` but reserved for non-paywall end-states; framing 429 as "Preview ended" was misleading (the user hadn't burned their trial — the IP bucket did).

**Chrome layout (all positioned relative to `MediaController`):**
- Top scrim — back button, `S<n>·E<n>` mono kicker, show — title, AirPlay, captions, quality menu trigger
- Center — `MediaSeekBackwardButton` (10s) / `MediaPlayButton` (72px frosted disc) / `MediaSeekForwardButton` (10s)
- Bottom — `MediaTimeRange` (red bar, halo thumb), `MediaTimeDisplay` × 2, mute, lock, playback rate, Episodes, Up Next, gear (quality), fullscreen
- Skip-intro chip (bottom-right) — visible only when `currentTime ∈ [intro_start, intro_end]`
- Quality menu — `<MediaRenditionMenu anchor="auto">`, pinned at `right-5 bottom-[92px]` so it can't be clipped by the player edge

**Chrome auto-hide:** driven by media-chrome's `media-ui-inactive` attribute on `<media-controller>`. Tailwind selectors target it: `group-[[media-ui-inactive]]/player:opacity-0`.

**Aspect ratio:** read off the underlying `<video>` element on `loadedmetadata`. Defaults to 16:9 until metadata arrives (~200ms flash on first frame). Applied to `MediaController` as `aspectRatio` plus `maxWidth: min(100vw, calc(100vh * <ratio>))` so portrait assets fill phone portrait viewports instead of being letterboxed into a 16:9 rectangle. Reset on episode swap.

**Episode swap (`?ep=<id>` URL sync):**

1. User clicks Episodes → overlay shows season-grouped list with real Mux thumbnails.
2. Selecting an episode → outer `Player` calls `setCurrentEpisodeId(id)` + closes overlay + `router.replace(?ep=<id>, { scroll: false })`. `?resume=` is stripped on swap so stale offsets don't replay.
3. The outer's `current.id` flips → the inner `EpisodePlayback` (keyed on `current.id`) unmounts and remounts. Token state, paywall flag, aspect ratio, caption detection, skip-intro chip, and last-saved position all start fresh — no manual resets in effect bodies.
4. The new inner's token-fetch effect fires on mount → pulls a JWT for the new episode. During the fetch the inner renders the "Loading" splash (`token === null`).
5. Subscriber: cross-session resume from `watch_progress` only applies to the initial episode (server-rendered); subsequent swaps start from 0 by design.
6. Trial: `trial_sessions` is keyed at the show level, so any episode in the show plays during the active trial window.

The downside of the keyed-remount pattern is a brief Loading splash on every swap (the `<MediaController>` + `<MuxVideo>` are torn down and rebuilt rather than reusing the same element with a new `playbackId`). The trade-off is that React 19's hook-rule lint passes cleanly and the per-episode state model stays simple — no `useEffect(() => setX(initial), [current.id])` reset patterns.

**Up Next:** the `<MuxVideo onEnded>` handler saves completion to progress and, if a next episode exists in the `episodes` list, sets `overlay="upnext"`. The card shows the next episode poster + label + 7-second countdown progress bar; **Watch now** swaps immediately, **Cancel** dismisses.

**Skip intro:** Player watches `timeupdate` and toggles a `showSkipIntro` state when `currentTime ∈ [intro_start, intro_end]`. Click → `video.currentTime = intro_end`. Markers are set in the admin episode-edit form (admin/shows/[id]/seasons/[seasonId]/episodes/[episodeId]) — both blank ⇒ chip hidden.

**Quality picker:** `<MediaRenditionMenuButton>` + `<MediaRenditionMenu>` from `media-chrome/react/menu`. The menu auto-populates from the active stream's HLS renditions (Auto + each variant) and dispatches `mediaratechangerequest` to lock to a level. Themed via `--media-menu-*` CSS variables on `MediaController`.

**Lock toggle:** sets a `locked` boolean; all chrome layers get `!opacity-0 !pointer-events-none` and a single "🔒 Tap to unlock" pill renders center. Tap unlocks.

**Token expiry:** refresh fires 60s **before** expiry (not at), so the new JWT installs while the old one still has headroom — Mux validates `exp` per-segment-request and a refresh exactly at the boundary loses the race for any segment going out a hair late. Subscriber gets a fresh 1h token via re-fetch; trial gets 403 → `videoRef.current.pause()` + `endState="paywall"` (this is what stops buffered-ahead chunks from running past the trial cutoff). 5xx/network errors retry with backoff (1s/2s/4s) before flipping to `unavailable` — a brief CDN blip doesn't black out the player. 429 routes to `rateLimited` end-state. The end-state branches use `classifyTokenStatus` to keep infrastructure failures from being framed as a payment issue.

## Mux thumbnail signing

`lib/mux-token.ts` exposes both signers:

```ts
signMuxPlaybackToken(playbackId, ttl)   // aud='v' (video)
signMuxThumbnailToken(playbackId, ttl)  // aud='t' (image)
```

Plus a `muxThumbnailUrl(playbackId, policy, opts)` helper that builds `https://image.mux.com/<id>/thumbnail.jpg?width=…&height=…&fit_mode=smartcrop[&token=<jwt>]`. Token is included only when the asset's `mux_playback_policy === "signed"`. TTL is 1h — long enough for typical sessions, short enough to avoid leaking long-lived URLs.

Consumed by: episodes overlay, up-next card, public show-detail episode rows. All pre-computed server-side in the route handlers / page components.

## Admin mutations

- **Delete confirmations**: all destructive admin actions (soft-delete show, delete season) use `components/admin/confirm-delete-button.tsx` — a client-side `<Button variant="destructive">` that calls `window.confirm(message)` before allowing the form submit. Prevents one-click data loss in the admin panel.
- **`softDeleteShow` revalidation**: the action revalidates both `/admin` (the show list) and `/` (the public catalog) so the soft-deleted show disappears from the homepage immediately, not just the admin panel.

## Admin analytics

`app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` is a server component that fires eight parallel Drizzle queries via `Promise.all`:

- Users: total + 30-day count
- Active subscriptions by plan (for MRR + active count)
- Cancellations in the last 30 days (for churn approximation)
- Trials started in the last 30 days + how many converted
- Top 10 shows by `SUM(watch_progress.position_seconds)` joined episodes → seasons → shows
- Daily signup buckets (`TO_CHAR(... AT TIME ZONE 'UTC', 'YYYY-MM-DD')`)

Rendered as metric cards + a 30-bar histogram + a normalized horizontal bar list. No Recharts dep — Tailwind/CSS only.

Approximations called out in code comments:
- Churn = cancellations / (cancellations + still-active). True churn needs a snapshot of "active at start of window," which we don't maintain.
- Watch time = sum of last-known position; doesn't account for repeat watching.

return 200 without re-applying. On handler exception the claim is
DELETED so Stripe's retry can re-attempt.

mirrorSubscription:
   - lookup user by stripe_customer_id
   - require current_period_end on access-granting statuses (throws if
       missing, so Stripe retries — defaulting to now() locked out
       just-paid users)
   - upsert subscriptions row keyed on stripe_subscription_id
     (partial unique index on (user_id) WHERE status IN active/trialing/
     past_due — only one access-granting row per user at a time)
   - paused → past_due (customer who pauses billing keeps access)
   - markUserTrialsConverted (active/trialing only)

**Subscription gate (read path).** Every place we check "is this user a subscriber?" — `/api/playback-token`, `app/watch/[showSlug]/page.tsx`, `saveWatchProgress` — goes through `hasActiveSubscription(userId)` in `lib/subscription-access.ts`. The filter is `status IN ACCESS_GRANTING_STATUSES AND current_period_end > now()`, ordered by `updated_at DESC LIMIT 1`. `ACCESS_GRANTING_STATUSES = ["active","trialing","past_due"]` — past_due grants access because Stripe is mid-retry on a failed invoice and locking the user out makes Customer-Portal recovery impossible. Defense-in-depth: even if a `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook is dropped and the row stays in an access-granting state in our DB, the period-end check expires playback at the user's actual term.

**Billing portal.** `/api/billing-portal` is the only entry — a GET handler that does auth + customer lookup + `stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create` + 302 in one server hop. The Clerk user-menu's "Manage subscription" item, the `/subscribe` "you're already subscribed" CTA, and any future "manage billing" affordance all link straight to it. There is no `/account` page.

`subscriptions.cancel_at_period_end` is OR'd from both `sub.cancel_at_period_end` and `sub.cancel_at != null` because the Customer Portal sets the timestamp form, not the boolean. See [gotchas](./gotchas.md#stripe-portal-cancel).

## Route protection (proxy.ts)

```ts
isAdminRoute = createRouteMatcher(["/admin(.*)"]);
isAuthRoute  = createRouteMatcher(["/subscribe(.*)"]);
```

- `/admin/*`: Clerk userId required, then DB lookup `users.role='admin'`. Non-admin → redirect `/`. The role read is wrapped in a module-scope 5-second cache (`roleCache: Map<userId, {role, expiresAt}>`) so RSC prefetch fan-out + matcher-caught traffic don't translate 1:1 into Neon queries — without it a single signed-in user could saturate the pooled connection by spamming admin URLs. Anonymous → `redirectToSignIn` (admins already have accounts).
- `/subscribe/*`: Clerk userId required. Anonymous → `redirectToSignUp({ returnBackUrl })` — the paywall conversion path defaults to creating an account; Clerk's hosted sign-up page links to sign-in for the minority returning case.
- `/watch/*`: public. Trial cookie is **not** set here — `/api/playback-token` mints it on first play, after verifying the show is published+ready.
- Everything else: passes through.

Public catalog (`/`, `/shows/[slug]`) isn't gated — it surfaces only `status='published' AND deleted_at IS NULL` rows.

## Accessibility

- **Skip-to-content link**: `app/layout.tsx` renders an `<a href="#main-content">` that is `sr-only` by default and becomes visible on focus. The `#main-content` div wraps `{children}` so keyboard users can skip past the header and nav.

## Error boundaries

- `app/(public)/shows/[slug]/error.tsx` — catches errors in the show detail page (bad DB query, missing show data after a race with soft-delete, etc.). Renders a "Something went wrong" fallback with a retry button.
- `app/subscribe/error.tsx` — catches errors in the subscribe page (Stripe config issues, missing price IDs, etc.). Same pattern.

Error boundaries are React client components (`"use client"`) that receive `error` and `reset` props. They don't catch errors in `layout.tsx` or in route handlers — only in the page component tree below them.

## Route groups

- `app/(public)/` — `/`, `/shows/[slug]` — root layout, no auth
- `app/admin/` — admin panel (own `layout.tsx`). Pages: `/`, `shows/new`, `shows/[id]`, `shows/[id]/seasons/[seasonId]`, `shows/[id]/seasons/[seasonId]/episodes/[episodeId]`, `analytics`
- `app/watch/[showSlug]/` — public + cookie-managed. Accepts `?ep=<id>` to start on a specific episode, `?resume=<seconds>` for cross-session resume.
- `app/subscribe/` — radio-card plan picker + animated submit (`submit-button.tsx` is the lone client component; the page itself stays a server component)
- `app/api/billing-portal/` — GET-only redirect to Stripe Customer Portal
- `app/api/webhooks/{clerk,mux,stripe}/` — external webhooks (`runtime = "nodejs"`, raw body verification)
- `app/api/playback-token/` — token issuer

## Server actions vs route handlers (CLAUDE.md convention)

- **Server actions**: app mutations (admin CRUD, startCheckout, openBillingPortal, saveWatchProgress, saveTrialPosition).
- **Route handlers**: webhooks from external services (Clerk/Mux/Stripe) and the JWT issuer (`/api/playback-token`).

Webhook handlers always declare `export const runtime = "nodejs";` — the SDK signature verifiers need raw bytes and don't run on the Edge. The `evt` / `event` variables are explicitly typed via `Awaited<ReturnType<…>>` of the respective SDK's verify/unwrap function — no implicit `any`.

## Why these specific choices

- **`postgres-js` over `neon-http`**: lets us run from any Node runtime (Vercel Functions + scripts) with one driver. `prepare: false` is required for Neon's pooled endpoint (pgbouncer transaction mode).
- **Drizzle over Prisma**: type-safe SQL, no engine binary, fast cold start.
- **shadcn over component library**: full source in `components/ui/` — modifiable, no upgrade churn. New shadcn uses Base UI (not Radix); `Button` lacks `asChild`. For "link styled as button" use `buttonVariants()`.
- **Mux signed playback (new uploads)**: `playback_policies: ["signed"]` + JWT enforces server-side gating. Public IDs are still played by mux-player (token ignored) — old assets remain accessible unless re-uploaded.
- **Trial cookie + table**: `cookie` survives across signed-out → signed-up → subscribed without losing the user's place. `trial_sessions.user_id` is nullable until signup; webhook flips `converted` once they pay. Cookie minting + row creation both happen in `/api/playback-token` (not proxy.ts) — that way the show is verified published+ready before any state is persisted, and the 60s clock starts on the user's first play rather than on page load. An HMAC-of-IP bucket caps trial creations at 3/(IP, show)/hour to stop the cookie-clear loop.
